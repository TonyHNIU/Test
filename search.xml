    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Since the original publish date of the article (January, 2017), a lot has changed for npm and yarn too. Most importantly, with the release of npm 5, package-lock.json was added to npm. package-lock.json is automatically generated and updated for any operations where the npm cli modifies the node_modules directory, or the package.json file. In addition to that, every “npm install“ automatically adds installed modules to both “package.json“ and “package-lock.json“ This file is meant to be committed into the version control you are using. With this feature, npm got feature parity with yarn, when it comes to lock file support. At the same time, yarn started to address issues that companies using mono repositories ran into. Namingly, monorepos with multiple packages, each containing a “package.json“ file. If you’d like to install dependencies for all of them with npm, that would include going over each directory and issuing “npm install“ in all of them. To help with this process, yarn introduced workspaces. In combination with Lerna, it gives package authors a powerful toolset to manage the dependencies and of projects and also enables publishing to be a lot easier.]]></content>
